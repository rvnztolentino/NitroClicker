# NitroClicker
NitroClicker is a lightweight console tool that enhances clicking efficiency with customizable clicks per second (CPS). Perfect for Minecraft PvP and various applications, it requires you to hold a key for continuous clicking.

You can set your desired Clicks Per Second (CPS) value, please be aware that the actual clicking speed may not always match your input. To help ensure you get a closer clicking speed to your desired CPS, consider setting your desired CPS value slightly higher than your intended rate. For example, if you want 30 CPS but experience lower CPS, you might try setting it to 32 or 35 CPS.
