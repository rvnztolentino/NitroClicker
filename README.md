# NitroClicker
NitroClicker is a lightweight console tool that enhances clicking efficiency with customizable clicks per second (CPS). Ideal for tasks that require rapid and continuous clicking, it activates when you hold a key, delivering consistent performance across various applications.

You can set your desired Clicks Per Second (CPS) value. Take note that the actual clicking speed may not always match your input. To ensure you get a closer clicking speed to your desired CPS, consider setting your desired CPS value slightly higher than your intended rate. For example, if you want 30 CPS but experience lower CPS, you might try setting it to 32 or 35 CPS.

You can now choose between the left, right, or middle mouse button for autoclicking. Simply click the button you want to use and it will be set as your selection for the autoclick function.

This section of the autoclicker allows the user to select their desired activation key. After inputting a key from A to Z, the program confirms the selection and instructs the user to hold down the chosen key to start the autoclicker. The autoclicker will remain active as long as the key is held, automatically clicking at the configured clicks per second (CPS) rate.
